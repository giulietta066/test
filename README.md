I figured out how to make folders but I accidently put comments stating delete within the folders? From my understanding I needed to have at least one file in the folder when it is created, I did not know how to transfer things right away so I made placeholders (intending to delete them once my actual files were moved). Disregard any comments or labels that say delete, I'll try to fix later.
